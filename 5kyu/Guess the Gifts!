# You will be given a wishlist (array), containing all possible items. 
# Each item is in the format: {name: "toy car", size: "medium", clatters: "a bit", weight: "medium"} 

# You also get a list of presents (array), you see under the christmas tree, which have the following format each: 
# {size: "small", clatters: "no", weight: "light"}

# Your task is to return the names of all wishlisted presents that you might have gotten.

# Rules
# Possible values for size: "small", "medium", "large"
# Possible values for clatters: "no", "a bit", "yes"
# Possible values for weight: "light", "medium", "heavy"
# Don't add any item more than once to the result
# The order of names in the output doesn't matter
# It's possible, that multiple items from your wish list have the same attribute values. 
# If they match the attributes of one of the presents, add all of them.
# Example
# wishlist = [{'name': "mini puzzle", 'size': "small", 'clatters': "yes", 'weight': "light"},
#             {'name': "toy car", 'size': "medium", 'clatters': "a bit", 'weight': "medium"},
#             {'name': "card game", 'size': "small", 'clatters': "no", 'weight': "light"}]
# presents = [{'size': "medium", 'clatters': "a bit", 'weight': "medium"},
#             {'size': "small", 'clatters': "yes", 'weight': "light"}]

# guess_gifts(wishlist, presents) # => must return ["Toy Car", "Mini Puzzle"]
