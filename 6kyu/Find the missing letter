# Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that 
# returns the missing letter in the array.

# You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. 
# The length of the array will always be at least 2.
# The array will always contain letters in only one case.

# Example:

# ['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e' ['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'

# ["a","b","c","d","f"] -> "e"
# ["O","Q","R","S"] -> "P"
# (Use the English alphabet with 26 letters!)
