# Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, 
# given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

# The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". 
# Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

# It is much easier to understand with an example:

# * For seconds = 62, your function should return
#     "1 minute and 2 seconds"
# * For seconds = 3662, your function should return
#     "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"

# For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.


def format_duration(seconds):

    if seconds == 0:
        return 'now'

    result = {}

    result["years"] = seconds // (86400*365)
    result["days"] = (seconds % (86400*365)) // 86400
    result["hours"] = (seconds % 86400) // 3600
    result["minutes"] = (seconds % 3600) // 60
    result["seconds"] = seconds % 60

    for key in result:
        if result[key] > 1:
            final[key] = result[key]
        elif result[key] == 1:
            final[key.rstrip('s')] = result[key]

    r = [f'{final[key]} {key}' for key in final]

    if len(r) > 1:
        return ', '.join(r[:-1]) + ' and ' + r[-1]

    else:
        return ''.join([f'{final[x]} {x}' for x in final])
