# Sudoku Solution Validator
# Write a function validSolution/ValidateSolution/valid_solution() that accepts a 2D array representing a Sudoku board, 
# and returns true if it is a valid solution, or false otherwise. The cells of the sudoku board may also contain 0's, 
# which will represent empty cells. Boards containing one or more zeroes are considered to be invalid solutions.

# The board is always 9 cells by 9 cells, and every cell only contains integers from 0 to 9.
