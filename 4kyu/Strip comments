# Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

# Example:

# Given an input string of:

# apples, pears # and bananas
# grapes
# bananas !apples

# The output expected would be:

# apples, pears
# grapes
# bananas
